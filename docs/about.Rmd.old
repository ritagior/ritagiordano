I am a data passionate who like tell stories and provide useful and clear data visualisation. 
Life brought me travelling all across Europe.
From the highest volcano in Europe, where I graduated in Physics, I landed to the French Alps to do a PhD at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in statistics and physics applied to structural biology. After my PhD, from Alps to Alps, I did my first postdoc at the Swiss Light Source (SLS).
Later on I moved to the capital of Europe to discover beautiful vineyards and to start to work as biostatistician. Never tired to travel and discover new places, I decided to come back to academic research and I started a second post-doc in one of the oldest university in Europe, Cambridge. After this great experience I continued my European tour and after a parental leave I began my data scientist adventure in Karlsruhe.
Afterwards I came back to Strasbourg to start a new life as data scientist freelance. Lastly I moved again to Cambridge.

I like to create visualisations and learning new stuff day by day. Please feel free to visit the section "Portfolio" to see some examples of what I do and I love to do.
