Life brought me travelling all across Europe. From the highest volcano in Europe, where I graduated in Physics, I landed to the French Alps to do a PhD at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in statistics and physics applied to structural biology. After my PhD, from Alps to Alps, I did my first postdoc at the Swiss Light Source (SLS). Later on I moved to the capital of Europe to discover beautiful vineyards and to start to work as biostatistician. Never tired to travel and discover new places, I decided to come back to academic research and I started a second post-doc in one of the oldest university in Europe, Cambridge. After this great experience I continued my European tour and after a parental leave I began my data scientist adventure in Karlsruhe. Afterwards I came back to Strasbourg to start a new life as data scientist freelance. Lastly I moved again to Cambridge where I worked a as a data scientist for the Royal Society of Chemistry and now I seek a new challenge in data visualisation.\n            I like to create visualisations and learning new stuff day by day.

      "contents": "\nI was really curious to see whether countries such as Italy (where I come from) has higher consumption of solar energy. So I started to check which countries in Europe hve the highest consumption of solar thermal heat for household. Solar energy can be a powerful and clean source of electricity and heating for households. From the data I analysed only countries on Southern and Western Europe produce high amounts of solar energy. The leading country in consumption of solar energy is Germany while, in Southern Europe, Greece and Spain are the ones that consume the most. Surprisingly, countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy, which have more days of sunlight than Western countries, use less solar energy. Italy and France, for instance, have a similar consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The idea behind this project was to find which was the topic for the article submitted in that issue. I thus performed a topic analysis using the title and abstract of the submitter’s papers. To represent the topic of each article I used a chord diagram, which I realised with the R package circlize.\nChord diagramBased on this analysis I have also realised the front cover for the journal issue (March 2020). I have designed the cover illustration by including the chord diagram obtained for the editorial article and using, as background, an handmade watercolour of the sea on the shore (made by me). What an honour to have my work on the cover!\nCover ESPI March 2020 Issue\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nI was interested to compare the fertility rate in the 2010s with the 1960s. The bar chart shows a decrease for each level of income of fertility rates in the 2010s. High income countries present a lower fertility rate than low income countries. It seems that the fertility rate decreases in places where women have access to higher education.\n\n\n\nWith Flourish I realised an interactive visualisation that shows the fertility rate by income worldwide. By changing the filter it is possible to spot the differences between the countries for the year 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitleFertility rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
