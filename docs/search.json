      "contents": "\nThe Data Visualization Society (DVS) performed in 2021 a survey\nfocused on the state of the industry, the Annual Data Visualization\nState of the Industry (SOTI). The DSV survey received 2165 answers and\n464 identified themselves as Freelance, Consultant or Independent\ncontractor. However, who identified their role as a freelance in most\ncases has also another job. For example out of this 464 freelance, 160\ncovered also positions in an organisation with some data visualization\njob responsibilities. Only 228 out of 464 participants of the survey\ndescribed their role only as Freelance, Consultant or Contractor.\nFreelance freedom to\nchoose their tool.\nThe word freelance historically indicates a medieval mercenary,\noriginally as two words free lance. The DSV survey asked\nthe freelances if the are free to choose their tool. Journalists and\ncartographers are completely free to choose their tool. The 82% of\nDesigners and only the 68% of Analysts are free to choose their tool.\nOverall, the majority of the participants are free to choose their\ntool.\n\n\n\nFreelance audience.\nAnother question was: “As a freelancer, who do you make data\nvisualizations for? Select all that apply.” The majority of the\nfreelancers identified as Designer, 30%, and their audience can be from\ngeneral public to analysts, from scientists to researchers. Designers,\nare the biggest proportion of freelancers and they also reach out almost\nall the audience indicate in the survey. Analysts, 20%, and Developers,\n16%, are the other roles that reach out the majority of the audience\nspecified in the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate visualisation\nThe beautiful of the DVS is that they gave me feed back of my\nvisualisation. This was really incredible! Below the new version after\nthe comments of the jury. Thanks DVS!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

So I started to check\nwhich countries in Europe hve the highest consumption of solar thermal\nheat for household. Solar energy can be a powerful and clean source of\nelectricity and heating for households. From the data I analysed only\ncountries on Southern and Western Europe produce high amounts of solar\nenergy. The leading country in consumption of solar energy is Germany\nwhile, in Southern Europe, Greece and Spain are the ones that consume\nthe most. Surprisingly, countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy, which\nhave more days of sunlight than Western countries, use less solar\nenergy. Italy and France, for instance, have a similar consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The idea behind this project was to\nfind which was the topic for the article submitted in that issue. I thus\nperformed a topic analysis using the title and abstract of the\nsubmitters’ papers. To represent the topic of each article I used a\nchord diagram, which I realised with the R package\ncirclize.\nChord diagramBased on this analysis I have also realised the front cover for the\njournal issue (March 2020). I have designed the cover illustration by\nincluding the chord diagram obtained for the editorial article and\nusing, as background, an handmade watercolour of the sea on the shore\n(made by me).
