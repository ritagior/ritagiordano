I am a physicist turned data visualisation designer and scientific illustrator. I am currently based in UK. Life brought me travelling all across Europe. From the highest volcano in Europe, where I graduated in Physics, to the French Alps for a PhD at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in statistics and physics applied to structural biology. After my PhD, from Alps to Alps, I did my first postdoc at the Swiss Light Source (SLS). Later on, I moved to the capital of Europe to work as biostatistician. Never tired to travel and discover new places, I decided to come back to academic research.  In 2014 I started a second post-doc in one of the oldest university in Europe, Cambridge. After this great experience, I continued my European tour. After a parental leave I began my data scientist adventure in Karlsruhe. Afterwards I came back to Strasbourg to start a new life as data scientist freelance. I moved again to Cambridge, working as data scientist and data visualisation designer. Now I seek a new challenge in data visualisation and scientific illustration.
