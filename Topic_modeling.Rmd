I prepared these visualisations for the editorial article of the journal "Environmental Science: Process and Impact" (2020) March Issue. The idea behind this project was to find which was the topic for the article submitted in that issue. I thus performed a topic analysis using the title and abstract of the submitter's papers. To represent the topic of each article I used a chord diagram, which I realised with the R package `circlize`.

Based on this analysis I have also realised the front cover for the journal issue (March 2020). I have designed the cover illustration by including the chord diagram obtained for the editorial article and using, as background, an handmade watercolour of the sea on the shore (made by me). What an honour to have my work on the cover!
